## Points I care about

- I used Parcel to package things.
- I used [InuitCSS Architecture](https://github.com/inuitcss/inuitcss) based on ITCSS and BEM Methodology. Probably you know that but this is not a CSS Framework like Bootstrap. It does not contain any cosmetics.
- I used comments to make things clear in HTML and CSS.
- I tried to use semantic syntax and accessibility attributes.
- I used inline SVG sprite.
- I tried to achieve pixel perfect by using screenshots as layers in Photoshop. See the [pixel-perfect.png](pixel-perfect.png) file.
- I used responsive images.
- I made sure that the real mobile experience can be tested at widths of 479px and below.
- I used mobile first approach.
- I checked Chrome, Firefox, Opera, Edge, IE11, iOS Safari/Chrome, Android Default/Chrome browsers.
- I fixed the select apperance issue at IE11.
- I fixed the iOS Safari input zoom problem caused by the input size being 15px (below 16px) and I made a SASS mixin for it.
- I couldn't solve the text ellipsis issue at select elements on IE11 with only CSS but I could with some Javascript by following [this approach](https://nikitahl.com/text-overflow-ellipsis-on-select-tag/).
- I tried to make usefull Vue components.
- I sent simple closure functions to the buttons via VueJS.
- I fixed `Object doesn't support property or method 'assign'` error on IE11 by using related pollyfill.

## My Qualifications

- I love CSS, Math and solving problems.
- I've been coding CSS since 2010.
- I also know NodeJS, PHP, Laravel, WordPress, bash and servers... In short I know back-end stuff.
- I'm good at reading and writing in English. I've been talking to Cambly teachers for two years now (you can verify that by following [this link](https://www.cambly.com/en/certificate/verify/f8478219)), so I'm good at listening and speaking too. I am comfortable in daily conversations but I must say that my vocabulary and grammar are poor.
